matplotlib wheel builder
########################

Repository to build OSX wheels for matplotlib.

To update:

* Update matplotlib with version you want to build:

    * cd matplotlib && git pull && git checkout DESIRED_TAG
    * cd .. && git add matplotlib

where "DESIRED_TAG" is a matplotlib git tag like "v1.3.1"

The wheels get uploaded to a `rackspace container
<http://a365fff413fe338398b6-1c8a9b3114517dc5fe17b7c3f8c63a43.r19.cf2.rackcdn.com>`_
to which I have the password.  The password is encrypted to this exact repo in
the ``.travis.yml`` file, so the upload won't work for you from another repo.
Either contact me to get set up, or use another upload service such as github -
see for example Jonathan Helmus' `sckit-image wheels builder
<https://github.com/jjhelmus/scikit-image-ci-wheel-builder>`_

I got the rackspace password from Olivier Grisel - we might be able to share
this account across projects - again - please contact me or Olivier if you'd
like this to happen.
